    For human: In summary, this site will not store your photos anywhere.
    This is purely on client, no external server. Actually it's hosted on github pages and you can view it here:
    <a href="https://github.com/aunnnn/EmojiFaces">https://github.com/aunnnn/EmojiFaces</a>.
    All it does is to let you select your Facebook's (or device's) photo and edit it.
    Then you can either post to Facebook or download for later use.
